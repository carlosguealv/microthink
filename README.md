# Microthink

This project implements a Small Language Model using Python and Pytorch Lightning, implementing the Mamba architecture for its neural blocks to ensure efficient and scalable performance.

## Features

- Mamba Architecture: Utilized for neural blocks to enhance scalability and efficiency.
- Python: The entire project is written in Python.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/carlosguealv/microthink.git
   ```

2. Train the model:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```

3. Use the checkpoints in the `checkpoints` folder to load the model.
